				<p align="left" class="style13" style="text-align:justify">In 2011, Dr. Ram Prakash P.T started his own Clinical practice in India after many
                failed attempts to go to USA. Since he want to overcome his failure he wished to turn his clinical practice just as it would be in USA, then he
                found the completely different health care delivery in US and India, he realized that Insurance covers most treatment techniques and standard
                procedures in US, but In India Insurance company's don't reimburse Physiotherapy treatment, this has caused the vast difference in the economic
                and social status of the profession in the two different countries at contemporary period.</p>

		<p align="left" class="style29" style="text-align:justify">He realized that not just Evidence based practice is the need of the hour, the practice
        itself should be evident, should be documented, and should be recordable, reproducible and researchable. He came with the idea of making a unique
        software for Indian Physiotherapy. Since 2011, he has been documenting the needs and the requirements of the software, until he met the right
        person to develop it that is Mr. Karna in January 2013.</p>
		<p align="left" class="style29" style="text-align:justify">Mr. Karna and Ram discussed the possibilities and difficulties, despite the unwelcoming future
        of the software, in the country where nobody has to document or has to be reimbursed, this software may be not mandatory here. Ram took a daring step to
        invest time and money in a belief that Indian physiotherapists will understand the need of the hour, the urge to grow, and the compulsion to uplift the
        profession is there in every physiotherapist. Adopting the software today by Indian physiotherapists will let the insurance companies to turn their attention
        towards us, while we will have documented years of clinical practice, we will have standardized the treatment producers.</p>
		<p align="left" class="style29" style="text-align:justify">The day is not very far, when Physiotherapists in India will be living an elite life at the society,
        the children will aspire a dream to become a physiotherapist by seeing your life. Lets Live an inspirational life.</p>
